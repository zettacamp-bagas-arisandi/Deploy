            <h1>The Characters</h1>
        <p>
            These are my favorite characters from <strong>Call Of Duty</strong>. <br>
            I played Call Of Duty since in High School.
            That was such a great memory, playing with my friends and follow the stories of the game until the end.<br>
            Last series that we played is <em>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.</em>
